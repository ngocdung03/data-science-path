##### Conditional prob: intermediate
-  Multiplication rule of probability: P(A∩B)=P(B)⋅P(A|B)
- In more general terms, if event A occurs and the probability of B remains unchanged and vice versa (A and B can be any events for any random experiment), then events A and B are said to be statistically independent (although the term "independent" is more often used).
    - P(A)=P(A|B)
    - P(A∩B)=P(A)⋅P(B)
