##### Introduction to SQL
- SQL style guide: https://www.sqlstyle.guide/
- We can not only compare a column with a value, but we can also compare columns to other columns.\: `WHERE Men < Women`
- Four types of SQL commands:
    - Data query language
    - Data definition language
    - Data control language
    - Data manipulation language

##### Summary Statistics
- Different to Aggregate functions, functions that, when we pass them a column as input, return (a transformation of the input) another column: LENGTH(), LOWER(), || operator for concatenate strings 
- If we try to divide two integer columns, SQLite (and most other SQL dialects) will round down and return integer values
