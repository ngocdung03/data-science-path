##### Introduction to k-nearest neighbor

##### Evaluating model performance
- Error metric quantifies how inaccurate our predictions were compared to the actual values
- Mean absolute error
- Mean squared error: For many prediction tasks, we want to penalize predicted values that are further away from the actual value far more than those closer to the actual value.
- While comparing MSE values helps us identify which model performs better on a relative basis, it doesn't help us understand if the performance is good enough in general. This is because the units of the MSE metric are squared.
- *Root mean squared error*
- To better understand a specific model, we can compare multiple error metrics for the same model (MAE and RMSE?)
```py
# Compare mae, rmse of one model
errors_one = pd.Series([5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10])
errors_two = pd.Series([5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 10, 5, 1000])

#mae_one = np.mean(errors_one.apply(lambda x: abs(x - errors_one.mean())))   # why wrong if chain .mean()?
mae_one = errors_one.mean()   #7.5
rmse_one = np.sqrt((errors_one**2).mean()) #7.9

mae_two = errors_two.mean()  #62.5
rmse_two = np.sqrt((errors_two**2).mean())  #235.8
```

While the MAE (7.5) to RMSE (7.9056941504209481) ratio was about 1:1 for the first list of errors, the MAE (62.5) to RMSE (235.82302686548658) ratio was closer to 1:4 for the second list of errors. In general, we should expect that the MAE value be much less than the RMSE value. When we're working with larger data sets, we can't inspect each value to understand if there's one or some outliers or if all of the errors are systematically higher. Looking at the ratio of MAE to RMSE can help us understand if there are large but infrequent errors.

##### Multivariate k-nearest neighbors
- When selecting more attributes to use in the model, we need to watch out for columns that don't work well with the distance equation:
    - non-numerical values
    - missing values
    - non-ordinal values (e.g. latitude or longitude)
